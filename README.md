Important things I've learned ~

# Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)
 - learn the importance of viewing initial data via histograms, swarmplots, and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF)
 - learn how to write an ecdf function that will take one dimension arrays
 - learn how to plot ecdf graphs
 - percentiles and box plots: middle 50% of data is the IQR, the whiskers extend out to extent of data or 1.5-2 IQR, anything beyond the whiskers are outliers
 - covariance, a measure of how two quantities vary together 
 - pearson correlation, unitless measure of how two quantities vary together, (cov)/[(std x)(std y)], between -1 and 1
 - probabilistic thinking and statistical inference, such as using probability to estimate the mean
 - hacker statistics - simulation of repeated measurements to compute probabilities 
 - Bernoulli trial - an experiment that has two outcomes: true or false, such as a coin flip
 - Poisson process - timing of events are independent of when the previous event happened
 - Poisson distribution - number of events (r) in a given time interval with an average rate of Î» arrivals per interval  
 - Normal/Gaussian distribution - the effect of std dev on the PDF and CDF, warnings of when data looks normally distributed but when its not
 - Exponential distribution - the timing between incidents of a Poisson distribution is exponentially distributed
