Important things I've learned ~

# Statistical Thinking in Python (Part 1)
 - learn the importance of viewing initial data via histograms, swarmplots, and empirical cumulative distribution functions (ECDF)
 - learn how to write an ecdf function that will take one dimension arrays
 - learn how to plot ecdf graphs
 - percentiles and box plots: middle 50% of data is the IQR, the whiskers extend out to extent of data or 1.5-2 IQR, anything beyond the whiskers are outliers
